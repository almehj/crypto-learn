I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GROW FLOWERS BUT MY GARDEN PRODUCES
JUST AS MANY DEAD LEAVES OLD OVERSHOE SPIECES OF ROPE
AND BUSHELS OF DEAD GRASS AS ANYBODYS AND TODAY I BOUGHT
A WHEELBARROW TO HELP IN CLEARING IT UP I HAVE ALWAYS 
LOVED AND RESPECTED THE WHEELBARROW IT IS THE ONE WHEELED
VEHICLE OF WHICH I AM PERFECT MASTER
