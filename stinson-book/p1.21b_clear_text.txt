I LEARNED HOW TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF PAPER NEEDED FOR A ROOM WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL
YOU MULTIPLY THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE WALLS BY THE CUBIC CONTENTS OF THE FLOOR AND
CEILING COMBINED AND DOUBLE IT YOU THEN ALLOW HALF THE TOTAL FOR OPENINGS SUCH AS WINDOWS
AND DOORS THEN YOU ALLOW THE OTHER HALF FOR MATCHING THE PATTERN THEN YOU DOUBLE THE
WHOLE THING AGAIN TO GIVE A MARGIN OF ERROR AND THEN YOU ORDER THE PAPER
