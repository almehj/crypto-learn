I GREW UP AMONG SLOW TALKERS MEN IN PARTICULAR WHO DROPPED
WORDS A FEW AT A TIME LIKE BEANS IN A HILL AND WHEN I GOT
TO MINNEAPOLIS WHERE PEOPLE TOOK A LAKE WOBEGON COMMA TO
MEAN THE END OF A STORY I COULDN'T SPEAK A WHOLE SENTENCE
IN COMPANY AND WAS CONSIDERED NOT TOO BRIGHT SO I ENROLLED
IN A SPEECH COURSE TAUGHT BY ORVILLE SAND THE FOUNDER OF
REFLEXIVE RELAXOLOGY A SELF HYPNOTIC TECHNIQUE THAT ENABLED
A PERSON TO SPEAK UP TO THREE HUNDRED WORDS PER MINUTE
