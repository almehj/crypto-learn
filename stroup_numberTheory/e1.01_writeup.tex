\begin{statement}{1.1}
Let $a,b,d \in \BZ$ with $d\ne 0$. Show that $a \mid b$ if and only if  $da \mid db$.
\end{statement}
\begin{proof}
Assume $a \mid b$, then there is a $z \in \BZ$ such that $az = b$. If
we multiply both sides by $d$, we get $adz = bd$, showing that $ad
\mid bd$.

Assume $ad \mid bd$, then there is a $z \in \BZ$ such that $adz = bd$. Since
$d\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $d$ to get $az = b$, showing
that $a \mid b$.
\end{proof}
